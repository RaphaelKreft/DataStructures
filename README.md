# DataStructures

This repository contains explanations as well as sample code(In Java and Python) for basic and advanced datastructures.
I created this to recap all my knowledge on Data Structures and In my hope this also helps one or the other curious
fellow out there to learn about the amazing world of Data Structures.

Beginning with basic DataStructures, I look forward to also include advanced and domain specific Data Strcutures, so that
a comprehensive collection will develop over time.

Every Data Structure will have its own folder and contains:
1. .md(markdown) File that describes the Datastructure in 2min reading time
2. implementation of the Datastructure in various languages (for now java and python are planned)
(3.) PDF/tex file that gives a deeper overview over the data structure

## Basic Data Structures

Are Data Structures that are the very basic foundation. Despite their relatively low
complexity, they are an essentail part of every Programmers skillset and are used by 
a lot of other Data Structures.

- Lists
  - (Double) Linked-List
  - (Single) Linked-List
  - Arraylist
- Graph
- Tree
  - Binary tree
- Stack
- Queue

## Advanced Data Structures

- Heap (Max and Min)
- Priority Queue
- Hashmap
